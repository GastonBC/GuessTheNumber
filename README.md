# The Numbers War

![SolvedGame](https://github.com/GastonBC/NumbersWarGame/blob/main/Images/SolvedGame.png)

How to play:

· You need to guess the other player's number. On your turn write a number and the opponent will tell you how many Good digits and how many Regular digits you have.

· A Good digit means one of your number's digits is correct and is in the correct location.

· A Regular digit means one of your number's digits is correct, but is in the wrong location.

· eg: If your opponent number is 1234 and your guess is 5261 you will get 1G - 1R because your 2 is in the correct location but 1 is not.
Those are your clues to guess your opponent's number.


Rules

· Minimum number length is 2, maximum is 10

· Digits in the number can not repeat (eg 1231 is wrong)

· Number can not contain letters
